# ARC competition

## What is ARC about?

The goal is to solve never-before-seen puzzles.

This is a contest that happens annually in December.

Each participant upload a docker image containing their puzzle solving code.

The contest organizers runs all the docker images.

Input/output is provided via the `/data` dir. Input is the puzzles. Output is the predicted solutions.

# What is the `arc-competition` dir?

This dir contain tools that automate constructing of a docker image.

```
PROMP> rake
rake buildx-build            # Create a docker image with the LODA-RUST executable inside
rake buildx-create           # Create a docker builder named 'my_loda_builder'
rake payload                 # Prepare the contents of the /root dir
rake remove-buildx-instance  # Remove the buildx instance - after building the docker image, it's no longer needed
rake run                     # Runs the LODA-RUST process in an isolated container, in an enviroment similar to the ARCathon submission specification
rake save-tar                # Export docker image to tar file
rake shell                   # Runs an interactive bash shell inside the docker image, so it's possible to troubleshoot
```

The `payload` dir is copied into the `/root` dir inside the docker image, which is the `$HOME` dir.

The `secret_data` dir is mounted at `/data` inside the docker image. This is how the docker image communicates with the outside world.

The `/data/solution/solution_notXORdinary.json` contains the predicted solutions. While the puzzle solver code is running, it continuously updates this file with its findings.

# Deploy docker image

These are the steps to create a docker image and submit it to the contest.

### Step 1 - Delete old buildx instance

```
PROMP> rake remove-buildx-instance
```

### Step 2 - Populate payload directory

This is the data that is stored inside the docker image, such as program files, analytics data.

```
PROMP> rake payload
```

### Step 3 - Create buildx instance

In order to cross compile for multiple architectures.

```
PROMP> rake buildx-create
```

### Step 4 - Create the docker image

This takes around 12 minutes to compile!

```
PROMP> rake buildx-build
```

### Step 5 - Save the docker image to a tar file

```
PROMP> rake save-tar

PROMPT>
```

### Step 6 - Run the docker image and see if it works

Manually copy around 60 json files from `ARC/data/training` to `secret_data/training`.

Check that this amount of json files are roughly also what is shows up when running the executable.

```
PROMP> rake run
1984-01-01T12:06:54Z - Start of program
initial program_item_vec: 66
initial model_item_vec.len: 63
snip output
CTRL-C to abort
```

Great this looks like the content of the `secret_data` has been mounted correct and the file has been discovered correct.

Now the `.tar` can be uploaded to the contest.

### Step 7 - Publish the docker image

Add the docker image `.tar` file to the [arcathon-docker-image](https://github.com/neoneye/arcathon-docker-image) repository.

After `git push` has finished.

Obtain the url for the docker image `.tar` file, that looks like this:

```
https://github.com/neoneye/arcathon-docker-image/raw/main/ARCathon2023/2023-02-26T13-03.tar
```

## Step 8 - Check that the docker image url actually downloads the file

Paste the docker image url into the browser.

Verify that a +100mb file gets downloaded.

Delete the downloaded file again.

## Step 9 - Submission

Great. This docker image is ready to be submitted.
