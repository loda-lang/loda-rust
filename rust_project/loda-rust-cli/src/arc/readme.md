# ARC is Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

As of 2023 ARC is unsolved.

Maybe LODA can be used for solving ARC? It got `score 6` out of 100. It's unclear if it's a good/bad approach.

ARC differs from OEIS in these ways:
- A LODA program for OEIS takes 1 input and returns 1 output. 
- A LODA program for ARC takes multiple inputs and returns multiple outputs.
- The way of mutating programs is the same for OEIS and ARC.
- The ARC code has lots of code for doing image manipulation.
