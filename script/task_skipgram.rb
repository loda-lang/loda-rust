Creates a skipgram with LODA instructions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram

Prerequisits:
The 'dotenv' gem. Install it using `$ gem install dotenv`
https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv

This script traverses all the programs inside the LODA program rootdir.
It looks for all the LODA assembly programs there are.
This script determines the most frequent combinations of instructions.

This script outputs a `skipgram.csv` file, with this format:

    count;word0;word1;word2
    17826;mov;skip;add
    15585;mov;skip;mov
    12458;mov;skip;lpb
    11971;add;skip;mov
    11942;mov;skip;sub
    11662;sub;skip;mov

Learnings from this skipgram with LODA programs:
Learning A: The `mov` and some junk is usually followed by the `add` instruction.
Learning B: The `add` and some junk is usually followed by the `mov` instruction.
Learning C: The `sub` and some junk is usually followed by the `mov` instruction.
