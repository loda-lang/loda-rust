rake data/loda-rust                          # compiles the loda-rust executable
rake data/most_called_programs.csv           # determine the most called programs

### Generate a CSV file with the most used programs

```
PROMPT> rake data/most_called_programs.csv
... snip, this task takes 3 minutes ...
PROMPT>
```

On successful completion there should be the file: `data/most_called_programs.csv`.


### Generate a CSV file with PageRank

This depends on the [PageRank tool](https://github.com/louridas/pagerank) being installed in the path.
See the `task_pagerank.rb` for instructions how to install the pagerank tool.

```
PROMPT> rake data/pagerank.csv
... snip, this task takes 3 minutes ...
PROMPT>
```

On successful completion there should be the file: `data/pagerank.csv`.
